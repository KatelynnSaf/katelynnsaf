Hey there, I'm Katelynn! I'm a Technical Underwriter with EMC Insurance Company. I'm looking to be hired as a Software Engineer. Born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa. 
I completed my certification with Thinkful for Software Engineering last year and have been working with code since I was 16. I'm truly passionate about the subject 
and hope to break into the medical technology field with a concentration in A.I. I love reading about software engineering and different approaches to
the field. Currently I'm learning about changing my development style to Test Driven Development(TDD). In my spare time I've also been working on courses through 
JetBrains Academy. I would love to collaborate on projects working with ML or any OOP based languages.
